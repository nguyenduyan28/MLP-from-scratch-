## Log for debug


* Current ds is a tuple for each element, but for data after random_split, it is a numpy array content all the image
* The problem maybe the indexing, now we try to know what is in indexing
* The ds_split is the tuple has 2 list, but we need a list which has tuple inside
* git add -- . ':!FashionMNIST/*'
